The love you once shared, like a flickering flame, had been extinguished, leaving behind only ash and longing.\n",

      "It wasn't the same fiery passion that ignited your initial relationship, but a gentle warmth started to bloom in its place.

Every touch, every shared look -  it was a slow dance of rediscovering what you once had. She laughed again, and the sound echoed in your soul like music long lost but finally found.\n",
